The trial court also did not err by concluding it was the parties' intent that, upon a party's death, the trust would be funded with one-half of the deceased party's total assets, not just the party's probate assets. The trial court also did not err by concluding that neither party, by entering into the agreement, intended to restrict his or her ability, upon the son's death, to convey as desired any residuary trust assets contributed by that party. But, in order to more efficiently implement the parties' intent, the trial court's judgment is modified to order the appellee/cross-appellant to use an already established trust to comply with the agreement, and the husband's estate is ordered to create a new trust to comply with the agreement.
