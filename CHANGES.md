# Change Log

As of this writing, in late 2020, we have issued over 400 releases. The vast
majority of these releases fix a scraper so it works better on a particular
court's website. When that's the case, we don't update the changelog, we simply
do the change, and you can find it in the git log.

The changes below represent changes in ambition, goals, or interface. In other
words, they're the ones you'll want to watch, and the others are mostly noise.

Releases are also tagged in git, if that's helpful.

## Coming up

 - N/A

## Current

**2.5.3 - 2022-04-30**

Fixes:
 - PACER document downloads will now throw a better error when a required
   client code is not provided during login.

## Past

**2.5.1 - 2022-04-25**

Features:

 - The `download_pdf` function used by PACER reports now returns a two-tuple
   containing the response object or None and a str. If there is an error,
   the response object will be None and the str will have the error message. If
   not, the response object will be populated and the str will be empty.

    To adapt to the new version you can change old code like this:

        r = report.download_pdf(...)

    To something like:

        r, _ = report.download_pdf(...)

    If you wish, you could instead capture errors with something like:

        r, msg = report.download_pdf(...)
        if msg:
            do_something()

    PhantomJS has not been supported for several years. Though it has served us
    well, the writing is on the wall that, like so many other once-useful
    technologies, it too had to be abandoned, only to be replaced by
    another tool. A tool that will be different in many ways, yet the same in
    its inevitable abandonment and mortality. Long live PhantomJS: Born a
    humble ghost; dying an immortal specter.
- 2.2.0, 2020-11-08 - Remove `_get_adapter_instance` method. It is unused, was
  a protected method, and causes many deprecation warnings in py3.

- 2.0.* - Adds support for Python 3.8 and supports Python 3, exclusively.  Begins testing to Github workflows and remove CircleCI.

  to consistently return None instead of sometimes returning []. Version bumped
